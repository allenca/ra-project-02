Shopping Cart

2017-02-07
Despite the extension, I encountered numerous difficulties expressing the funtionality as code, as well as continuously debugging the code that I thought would work. 

It was frustrating to formulate questions to ask because I felt the difficulties I was experiencing were fundamental ones as well as specific code related ones. Attempting to combine javascript and jQuery in a single line of code pushed me to watch tutorial videos on javascript called Practical Javascript that a web dev friend recommended for fundamental understanding that would be critical to future work skills. However, this also required time away from working on the project itself, but I felt it would better serve me in the long run, as well as in the short run to understand the code I was working with and the data I was trying to manipulate.

I decided not to try to reverse-engineer a shopping cart from finished code because I believe that I should keep working towards the realization of this shopping cart functionality from the ground up, after the project deadline, to better develop my logic and coding skills. I'm not sure about whether this was the right decision, but it's one that I had to make.

I did create the remote repository from scratch, though by following instructions. I also pursued learning and trying to solve npm and later, nvm issues, as I initially tried to avoid using sudo commands in terminal. This was because stack overflow answers led me to believe that working around permissions with sudo would eventually cause more issues that would be difficult to solve. However, with the deadline coming up, I resorted to using sudo commands again to install devDependencies correctly. I feel more confident in creating package.json files and installing devDependencies correctly and troubleshooting those issues. I am more comfortable with debugging html and css errors, as well as styling elements when compared to just after Project 1b. 

This was a frustrating experience because the cart does not function as was required, but I try to remain positive and future-facing about the experience.

Could not remove a file from the repository using terminal. Had to delete the remote repository and reload the correct files.
